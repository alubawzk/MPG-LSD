# MPG-LSD: Line segment detection based on multi-scale perceptual grouping
## 1. Illustration
- This is a simple demo for our paper "MPG-LSD: Line segment detection based on multi-scale perceptual grouping". 
- Use of our code for any other than research purposes is prohibited.

## 2. Requirements
- Windows 64 bit
- MATLAB R2020a

## 3. How to use
- This demo can be easily used by running the 'run_MPGLSD.m' file.
- We will release the details once the paper is published.

## 4. Evaluation
- The code and experimental results used for evaluation are available on:
